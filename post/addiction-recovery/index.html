Underlying Principles The reason behind addiction is the increase in dopamine. Chocolate increases it by 55%. Nicotine raises it by 150%. Amphetamine boosts it by 1000%. The main role of dopamine is not to make us feel happy after receiving a reward but to drive people to seek rewards. For example, when you see chocolate, dopamine activates the brain&rsquo;s reward circuit, making you feel pleasure even before having it and prompting you to eat it. The regions in the brain responsible for pleasure and pain overlap. Pleasure and pain have self-regulating functions. When you&rsquo;re currently experiencing pleasure, the brain will generate enough pain on the other side to balance it out. Reward Prediction Error Due to neural adaptation, the actual reward must exceed expectations to have a positive dopamine effect. In severe addiction, the threshold for feeling pleasure increases, resulting in a lack of enjoyment. Utilizing the Dopamine Mechanism According to clinical experience, recreating the brain&rsquo;s reward circuit takes at least a month. Using pain to treat pain The brain uses pain to balance out pleasure and vice versa. According to research, dopamine levels in the blood plasma increase by 250% when people immerse themselves in cold water, and this effect lasts longer than the immersion time. Exercise is the best option. Physical separation Completely separate from the addictive substance. Radical honesty The prefrontal cortex is responsible for rational decision-making. When the dopamine reward circuit is active, lying inhibits the prefrontal cortex&rsquo;s function, releasing the restraint on the reward circuit, leading the brain to believe it&rsquo;s not addicted. An essential part of addiction recovery is rebuilding the relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the dopamine circuit. Strengthen the prefrontal cortex by &ldquo;telling the truth&rdquo; and enhance self-control. During addiction, engage in self-talk or announce your addiction to people around you. '>

    <p>This note is from the video <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbbyLeR1ZRk"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >心河擺渡-成瘾始于痛苦，戒瘾终于平衡！深度解读多巴胺，用身体内稳态戒瘾</a> The video contains insights from the author as well as his analysis of Anna Lembke&rsquo;s book <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Drug-Dealer-MD-Doctors-Patients/dp/1421421402"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Drug Dealer, MD: How Doctors Were Duped, Patients Got Hooked, and Why It’s So Hard to Stop.</a> The content is very useful, and I made notes to remind myself.</p>
<h2 id="underlying-principles">Underlying Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>The reason behind addiction is the increase in dopamine.
<ul>
<li>Chocolate increases it by 55%.</li>
<li>Nicotine raises it by 150%.</li>
<li>Amphetamine boosts it by 1000%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The main role of dopamine is not to make us feel happy after receiving a reward but to drive people to seek rewards.
<ul>
<li>For example, when you see chocolate, dopamine activates the brain&rsquo;s reward circuit, making you feel pleasure even before having it and prompting you to eat it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The regions in the brain responsible for pleasure and pain overlap.
<ul>
<li>Pleasure and pain have self-regulating functions. When you&rsquo;re currently experiencing pleasure, the brain will generate enough pain on the other side to balance it out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reward Prediction Error
<ul>
<li>Due to neural adaptation, the actual reward must exceed expectations to have a positive dopamine effect.</li>
<li>In severe addiction, the threshold for feeling pleasure increases, resulting in a lack of enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="utilizing-the-dopamine-mechanism">Utilizing the Dopamine Mechanism</h2>
<ul>
<li>According to clinical experience, recreating the brain&rsquo;s reward circuit takes at least a month.</li>
<li>Using pain to treat pain
<ul>
<li>The brain uses pain to balance out pleasure and vice versa.
<ul>
<li>According to research, dopamine levels in the blood plasma increase by 250% when people immerse themselves in cold water, and this effect lasts longer than the immersion time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exercise is the best option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physical separation
<ul>
<li>Completely separate from the addictive substance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Radical honesty
<ul>
<li>The prefrontal cortex is responsible for rational decision-making.</li>
<li>When the dopamine reward circuit is active, lying inhibits the prefrontal cortex&rsquo;s function, releasing the restraint on the reward circuit, leading the brain to believe it&rsquo;s not addicted.</li>
<li>An essential part of addiction recovery is rebuilding the relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the dopamine circuit.</li>
<li>Strengthen the prefrontal cortex by &ldquo;telling the truth&rdquo; and enhance self-control.
<ul>
<li>During addiction, engage in self-talk or announce your addiction to people around you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
